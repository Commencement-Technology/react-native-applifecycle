âš› Provides functionality to determine whether the app is in the foreground or background and notifies you when the state changes.

It implements the [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle) for **Android** and falls back to the [AppState](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appstate) for **iOS**.

## Why Use This?

The original [AppState](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appstate) API provided by React Native behaves differently between Android and iOS, particularly regarding the `background` state:

- On iOS, the `background` state signifies that the entire app is in the background.
- On Android, the `background` state indicates that the React Native Activity is in the background, which might not necessarily mean the entire app is in the background.

By using `react-native-applifecycle`, you can handle these differences seamlessly across both platforms.

## Install

Install dependency package
```bash
yarn add react-native-applifecycle
```
Or
```bash
npm i -S react-native-applifecycle
```

## Usage

The App Lifecycle API is compatible with the original [AppState](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appstate).

### Subscribing to the `change` listener:

```tsx
import {AppLifecycle} from 'react-native-applifecycle';

const App = () => {

  useEffect(() => {
    const listener = AppLifecycle.addEventListener('change', state => {
      // do something
    });

    return () => listener.remove();
  }, []);

  return <View />;
}

export default App;
```

### Getting the current state with `hook`:

```tsx
import {useAppLifecycle} from 'react-native-applifecycle';

const App = () => {
  const currentLifecycle = useAppLifecycle();

  // do something

  return <View />;
}

export default App;
```
