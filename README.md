âš› Provides functionality to determine whether the app is in the foreground or background and notifies you when the state changes.

It implements the [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle?hl=pt-br) for **Android** and falls back to the [AppState](https://archive.reactnative.dev/docs/appstate) for **iOS**.

## Why Use This?

The original [AppState](https://archive.reactnative.dev/docs/appstate) API provided by React Native behaves differently between Android and iOS, particularly regarding the `background` state:

- On iOS, the `background` state signifies that the entire app is in the background.
- On Android, the `background` state indicates that the React Native Activity is in the background, which might not necessarily mean the entire app is in the background.

By using `react-native-applifecycle`, you can handle these differences seamlessly across both platforms.

## Install

Install dependency package
```bash
yarn add react-native-applifecycle
```
Or
```bash
npm i -S react-native-applifecycle
```
